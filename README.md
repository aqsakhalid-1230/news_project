# News App

This project is a multi-lingual application that fetches News articles from a news API endpoint and displays on a frontend application.

In this app I am getting the products data from the news api endpoint and made a proxy app in python to fetch the news articles and then called that API endpoint from my frontend to display with theme and language selectors using MUI.

## Features

- Python Proxy: A python view that returns the fetched news articles from the news API.
- NewsCard: News cards in typscript that shows each fethced articles from the API.
- Theme selector: A light/dark mode selector to change the theme of the application.
- Language selector: A selector to choose the language for articles to be fetched in.
- Topic chips: Chips to indicate for which topic articles need to be fetched.
